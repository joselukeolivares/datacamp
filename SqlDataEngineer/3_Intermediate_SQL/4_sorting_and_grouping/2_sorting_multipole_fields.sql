Sorting multiple fields

ORDER BY can also be used to sort on multiple fields. It will sort by the first field specified, then sort by the next, and so on. As an example, you may want to sort the people data by age and keep the names in alphabetical order.

Try using ORDER BY to sort multiple columns.
