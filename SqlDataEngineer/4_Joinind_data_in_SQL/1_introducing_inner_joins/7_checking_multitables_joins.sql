/*
Checking multi-table joins

Have a look at the results for Albania from the previous query below. You can see that the 2015 fertility_rate has been paired with 2010 unemployment_rate, and vice versa.
name 	year 	fertility_rate 	unemployment_rate
Albania 	2015 	1.663 	17.1
Albania 	2010 	1.663 	14
Albania 	2015 	1.793 	17.1
Albania 	2010 	1.793 	14

Instead of four records, the query should return two: one for each year. The last join was performed on c.code = e.code, without also joining on year. Your task in this exercise is to fix your query by explicitly stating that both the country code and year should match!

--Instructions:
    --Modify your query so that you are joining to economies on year as well as code
*/
SELECT name, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON c.code = e.code
-- Add an additional joining condition such that you are also joining on year
AND p.year=e.year;
