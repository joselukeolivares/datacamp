Your recent learnings

When you left 19 hours ago, you worked on Common data problems, chapter 1 of the course Cleaning Data in Python. Here is what you covered in your last lesson:

You learned about the importance of cleaning data to ensure the integrity of your analysis in the data science workflow. Specifically, you focused on:

    Data Type Constraints: Understanding that data must be in the correct format for analysis. For example, numerical data represented as strings can lead to incorrect analysis outcomes.
    Converting Data Types: You practiced converting string data to numerical types using the .astype() method. This is crucial when you need to perform mathematical operations on data initially read as strings.
    Stripping Unwanted Characters: Using the .str.strip() method to remove unwanted characters from data, such as currency symbols, which allows for the conversion of string data to numerical types.
    Assert Statements: You learned to use assert statements to verify that your data transformations have been successful. For instance, ensuring that a column's data type has been changed as expected.

Here's a snippet from the lesson demonstrating how to clean and convert a duration column from strings to integers:


# Strip duration of minutes
ride_sharing['duration_trim'] = ride_sharing['duration'].str.strip('minutes') 

# Convert duration to integer
ride_sharing['duration_time'] = ride_sharing['duration_trim'].astype('int')

# Assert the conversion was successful
assert ride_sharing['duration_time'].dtype == 'int'


This lesson laid the foundation for addressing common data problems, emphasizing the importance of having data in the correct format for analysis.

The goal of the next lesson is to learn how to apply data range constraints in Python using pandas to ensure the quality of data by correcting out-of-range values.
